# Trello
submission for PennLabs round 2 interview

I am completely new to working with backend APIs and databases, so I went with Flask for this project. That said, I am fully aware that the code in this repository does not run properly (still unfamiliar with the syntax and rules). I still hope the readers can look through the code and see my thought process. 

Thank you for this opportunity to learn! It's been fun-- I am definitely looking forward to gaining more familiarity with this type of coding.
